# BoruvkaAlgorithm
Repository of the BoruvkaAlgorithm that finds the Minimal Spanning Tree(MST) in Python.

This project was developed as part of the discipline Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms (ASA) of the Computer Engineering/Computer Science course. 
It was implemented entirely in the Python programming language and the algorithm itself was inspired by GeeksForGeeks' code on Boruvka's algorithm and also used the NetworkX library to visually represent the graphs.
